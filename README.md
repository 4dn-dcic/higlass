### Introduction

HiGlass is a web-based viewer for genome interaction maps
featuring synchronized navigation of multiple views as well as continuous zooming and panning
for navigation across genomic loci and resolutions. It supports visual comparison of
Hi-C and other genomic data from different experimental conditions and can be used to efficiently
identify salient outcomes of experimental perturbations, generate new hypotheses, and share
the results with the community.

A live instance can be found at [http://higlass.io](http://higlass.io). A [Docker container](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/higlass-docker) is available.

For documentation about how to use and install HiGlass, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/higlass/wiki).
